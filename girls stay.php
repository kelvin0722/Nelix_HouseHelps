<li><b>Unfair treatment.</b></li>
<p>The way you treat a house-help determines how long she lasts. if you are a harsh employer, she will not last for long. A good employer treats her girl like family. But some women are unkind and inhuman towards the girls. They mistreat them, make them work for long hours and under unfair conditions.</p>

<br>

<li><b>Over delegating</b></li>
<p>There is a trend where career mothers are over-delegating and outsourcing their responsibilities to the house girls. In some homes, the house girl is expected to feed and change the infants even at night despite spending the entire day with the baby. The baby cot is moved into the nanny's room while the mother gets her full sleep. This is unfair as the house girls need to rest to replenish her energies for the next day. In such a case, the child becomes overly attached to the domestic worker and perceives them to be their sole care giver. Parents should bathe their children so that in case they have any injuries, they can notice it. There are also some chores, which are personal and should not be done by the house help such as washing under wears for adults and teenagers. Parents must train their older children to be self-sufficient as they prepare them for college years. </p>

<br>

<li><b>Television</b></li>
<p>As an employer,i t is good to set your expectations of the domestic worker. As you are orienting them, give them guidelines on what to watch on television and when to watch so that children are not exposed to adult content. Employers should also set rules on mobile phones. House helps with loud earphones can barely hear the baby crying or hear you instructing them to do a particular chore.</p>

<br>

<li><b>Set dress code</b></li>
<p>To prevent employers from constantly arguing with house helps regarding provocative clothes like tight trousers, I recommend the use of uniforms which are presentable.</p>

<br>

<li><b>Be human</b></li>
<p>Domestic workers should be respected and treated as professionals. Give them a clean, warm bed to sleep on, free from bedbugs and mosquitoes. Give them soap and tissue for personal grooming and let them eat the food you are eating, so that she does not have to steal your delicates. Offer them fair working hours so that they do not sleep so late and worn out. It is important that they get an off day so that they can run their personal errads.</p>

<br>

<li><b>Good salary and medical benefits</b></li>
<p>Employers should pay their domestic workers an amount that is commensurate to the work load. Other benefits that should be given are NHIF, NSSF and advice them to join a suitable micro-finance organisation like jamii bora and maona investment where they can borrow sof loan when need be. Finally, if you are in a circle where you change like three girls in a month, you need to re-evaluate yourself and see if there is something you are not doing right. In any case, it is not possible that all the girls have a problem. It could be you!
